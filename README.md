### Instructions
1. **Create the Notebook**:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook (`jupyter notebook` in terminal).
   - Create a new notebook named `delivery_time_prediction.ipynb`.
   - Copy the single-cell code into one cell and run it.
2. **Save the Dataset**: Ensure `updated.csv` is in the same directory.
3. **Setup GitHub**:
   - Create a new repository (e.g., `delivery-time-prediction`).
   - Upload `delivery_time_prediction.ipynb`.
   - Add the `README.md` content as the repository description.

This single-cell version keeps everything compact while still delivering all functionality and visualizations. Let me know if you need further tweaks!
